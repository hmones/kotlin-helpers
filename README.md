# Kotlin Helper Functions

The library has various handy helper functions that can be used in your Kotlin projects.

1. The first function is `filterIfAllNulls()`:
   The function is chained on data classes. It returns null if all declared members of the class are having null values
   otherwise it returns the original object.
